Perceptia
=========

Do you like configurability and lightweightness of tiling window managers? Do you like cutting-edge
technology and want to try a tiling window manager running on Wayland? `perceptia` is for you!
`perceptia` tries to merge concepts from most popular tiling window managers like `i3`, `awesome`,
`ratpoison` or `dwm` with the freshness of Wayland.

There are still many things to work on. If you are looking for a working compositor it is much too
early to choose `perceptia`, but if you have programming skills and want to join the development team,
your help will be appreciated.
